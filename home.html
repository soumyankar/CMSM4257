	<p>The human factor exerts a dominant influence on road safety.The implementation of measures that may effectively influence the behaviour of road users are recognized, therefore, as a vital aim of road safety activities.</p>

		<p>Road safety campaigns are an important tool for reaching this aim. Indian roads are the most dangerous in the world, given that, on an average, there is an accident every minute and a fatality every four minutes. Over 10 lakh Indians have lost their lives in road accidents over the past 10 years and road traffic injuries are a leading cause of death for young people between 15 and 29 years.</p>
