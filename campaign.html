<p>The following satefy measures have been taken:</p>

<h2>Road Safety Rules and Regulations</h2>

<h3>General Safety Measures</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Keep To Your Left – </b> Always drive or ride on the left side of the road and let other vehicles overtake you from the right side.</li>
	<li><b>Stay Left When You Turn Left – </b> When turning towards left, start with approaching the curb from the left-most lane and ensure there’s enough distance for oncoming vehicles to pass.</li>
	<li><b>Turn Right –</b> Come to the centre of the road before you start turning right but when going around the curb, try to stay towards the left-most part of your lane to avoid contact with oncoming traffic.</li>
	<li><i>Always Overtake from the right side</i></li>
	<li><i>Be extra careful on intersections. Also, when passing through them, ensure your vehicle doesn’t cause inconvenience to other road users.</i></li>
	<li><b>Obstruction of View –</b> You should always have a clear view of the road ahead. Therefore, your car’s windshield shouldn’t have stickers that might obstruct your view.</li>
	<li><b>Tractor and Goods Carriages – </b>It is prohibited to carry passengers on a tractor or a goods carrier.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Road Safety Rules for Kids / Children</h3>
<p>Your kid should know about basic traffic signals, such as vehicles have to stop at the ‘red’ light and ‘green’ means the vehicle should resume driving, etc. Doing so will help them understand that they can cross a road once the vehicles come to a stop.</p>

<h3>Always Pay Attention – Listen to Warnings</h3>
<p><b>Pay Attention</b> – Ask your kids to pay attention to horns and even to sounds of the vehicle so that they can judge if there is some car or motorcycle driving towards them from a bend or from behind.</p>

<h3>Never Run On Busy Roads and Crossing Time</h3>
<p><b>Don’t Run On Roads –</b> Children should never run on roads as that might not only cause them to lose balance and fall on a busy street but also because it might confuse other road-users, who might end up colliding with the kid.</p>
